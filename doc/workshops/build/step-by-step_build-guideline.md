## 1. Wood processing:

### Planks cut / mitred
The metal ends are cut off the scaffolding planks. The planks are then cut to size and provided with a 45° miter on the abutting edge.

### Lamello
The planks are aligned and marked. Grooves for the lamellas are milled on the miter cut with the lamella milling cutter. When gluing, these are used to ensure that the two planks remain in position and do not slip when they are clamped.

### Grinding inside
Before the planks are glued, we close the inside, as it is more difficult to grind at an angle afterwards.

### Glueing
The glue is applied to the miter cut with the Lamellos. Adhesive tape is then quickly positioned and pulled tight so that the planks stick together as best as possible. Excess glue is wiped away with a damp cloth.

### Plastering break edges 
After the glue has dried and the clamps have been loosened, the edges of the plank are broken off and any excess is repaired. This means that the edges are sanded flush all around.

### Grinding the outside
Then all other wooden surfaces are sanded evenly with 180 grit sandpaper.

### Oiling
After sanding, the wood is treated on all sides with hard wax oil, a brush and a cloth and left to dry for at least 12 hours with good ventilation.

## 2. Plastic processing

### Beam cutting
The plastic beams are cut to size.

### Connections saws
Connections are marked on the bars. Saw is adjusted to beam height. Width stop to ⅓ of the beam thickness. (Note the tear side!) Slot and tenon connections are sawn.

### Drill connections
Holes for the round wooden rods are drilled in the center of the connections with a Forstner bit.

### Pre-drill screw holes
The holes for the screws are pre-drilled on the beams that will later be drilled onto the wood.

### Sawing round bars
The round bars are sawn to the beam thickness.

### Build rack
The beams are plugged into each other and the round rods are inserted into the connections.

## 3. Montage
The finished frame is aligned with the glued wood and connected with the screws.
