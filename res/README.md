# README `res/`

Stands for "resources", and should hold any files that are part of the sources of the project, but are not source code, design, scripts or documentation text files. This includes also binary files, next to text files. The sub-dirs within res/assets/ and res/ should be the same (excluding of course res/assets/assets/).
